# House Price Prediction - Machine Learning(Python)

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The dataset used for training and testing the model is [provide_dataset_source]. The goal is to create a reliable model that can accurately predict house prices given specific input parameters.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset, visualize key features, and identify patterns.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- Model Development: Implement and train machine learning models for house price prediction.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and cross-validation.
- Deployment: (Optional) If applicable, deploy the model for real-time predictions.

## Type of model built:
- Supervised Learning
- Regression Task

## Permormance Measure:
- RMSE(Root Mean Square Error)

# Models used:
- Linear Regression
- DecisionTreeRegressor
- RandomForestRegressor

# Model Outputs

1. Decision Tree:
    Mean:  4.189504502474483
    Standard deviation:  0.848096620323756

2. Linear Regression:
    Mean:  4.221894675406022
    Standard deviation:  0.7520304927151625

3. Random Forest Regression
    Mean:  3.494650261111624
    Standard deviation:  0.762041223886678

# Results:
Include visualizations, tables, or metrics showcasing the model's performance. This can include training/validation/test set results, feature importance, or any other relevant information.
- Clearly Randon Forest Regression works best for me.
